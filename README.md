# budget-app
Writing a self-maintained budgeting app that follows the envelope budgeting format.

TO DO:
Decide how to code the back end to store values for the different envelopes.
Create GUI to interact with envelope values.

NICE TO HAVE:
A button to distribute paycheck to envelopes on pay day.
Reminders to add transactions that happen automatically (e.g. autopay bills).
